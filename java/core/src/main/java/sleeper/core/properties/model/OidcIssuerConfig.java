/**
 * Configuration for a single OIDC issuer whose JSON Web Tokens the Sleeper REST API will accept.
 * <p>
 * An issuer establishes only who a client is. It never grants any permissions, as Sleeper roles come solely from the
 * principal allow-list. This means a claim in a token issued by a configured issuer cannot grant access to Sleeper.
 * <p>
 * Signing keys are supplied either by a JWKS URI the API will fetch, or by a public key held directly in the
 * configuration. The public key avoids any network call to the issuer, which is needed when the API cannot reach the
 * issuer.
 *
 * @param name              the name identifying this issuer in Sleeper configuration and in API responses
 * @param issuer            the issuer identifier, which must exactly match the iss claim in tokens from this issuer
 * @param audiences         the audiences accepted in the aud claim, of which a token must carry at least one
 * @param jwksUri           the URI to fetch this issuer's JSON Web Key Set from, or null if a public key is set
 * @param publicKey         this issuer's signing key, held directly so that no network call is needed, or null if a
 *                          JWKS URI is set
 * @param tokenEndpoint     the endpoint where automation can exchange client credentials for a token, reported by the
 *                          API so that scripts do not need to hard code it, or null if not known
 * @param authEndpoint      the endpoint a browser sends someone to in order to sign in, or null if not known
 * @param clientId          the application a client signs in to, which a browser must name when it sends someone to
 *                          sign in, or null if not known
 * @param principalClaim    the claim holding the identifier of the client, used to look them up in the principal
 *                          allow-list
 * @param clockSkewSeconds  how much clock difference to tolerate when checking token expiry
 * @param requiredClaims    claims a token must carry to be accepted, by name and the value each must hold, or
 *                          empty to check only the issuer, audience and expiry
